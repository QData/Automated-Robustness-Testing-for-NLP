# Mutation Based Fuzzing


Some inputs generated by random fuzzing, may just be purely invalid. 

Mutation Testing
We want a valid input, so we insert, delete or substitute random characters. 
Mutation gives us more valid inputs in comparison to completely random fuzzy mutators. 

__Parameter: type of mutation, number of mutations[range]__

## Guiding by Coverage
This adds inputs to a set, that increase the unique coverage path. If we plot curve of number of coverage vs number of seed inputs:
Mutation Fuzzing has higher ROC than Random Fuzzing.
