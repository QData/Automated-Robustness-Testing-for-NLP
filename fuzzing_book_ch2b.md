# Code Coverage

How to check if fuzzing is useful?
1. Number of bugs
2. likelihood of catching bugs: amount of code functionality covered

2 is better

## Two types of testing 
|  White Box | Black Box  |
|---|---|
| implementation based  | specifications based  |
| -  cannot detect missing implementation for specificaiton |-  implementation set much larger than specified set  |
|  needs trace execution tracker |  needs behaviour specification |
| measured by statement and branch coverage| - |


## Code Coverage enables checking quality of test input and also direct tests towards maximizing this criterion.
