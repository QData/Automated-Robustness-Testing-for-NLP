# Automated-Robustness-Testing-for-NLP
## Why is testing DNNs important?
DNNs are modern software being deployed everywhere. Like other software these must be tested for corner cases(when the software is likely to be problematic). 
## Why is testing DNNs hard?
DNNs have too many parameters: too many neurons. Manually finding corner cases is too difficult. Need automated testing , i.e. generating automatically corner cases for large DNNs.
